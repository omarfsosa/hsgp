    "* `tyw`: _Similar_ to \"Model 4: long term smooth + seasonal + weekday with increasing magnitude\". The difference is that I used a sum-to-zero constrain for the day-of-week effect rather than setting the effect of Mondays to zero.\n",
    "* `tywd`: _Similar_ to \"Model 8+RHS: day of year effect with RHS prior\". The difference is that I used `slab_scale=50` instead of `100`. I initially tried it with a value of 50 but found that my chains were getting stuck at the initialization point. Another difference is that there seems to be a mistake in the code of the original blogpost because the prior of β4 appears duplicated (it has a first a normal prior and then a horseshoe prior). I'm pretty confident this is a typo so I've not included the duplicated prior, I only use the horseshoe prior."
